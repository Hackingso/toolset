### Reverse Engineering/Exploitation
- [radare2](https://github.com/radare/radare2): (also known as r2) is a complete framework for reverse-engineering and analyzing binaries; composed of a set of small utilities that can be used together or independently from the command line.

- [qemu](https://github.com/qemu/qemu) ([official site](http://www.qemu-project.org/)): QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer. ... QEMU supports virtualization when executing under the Xen hypervisor or using the KVM kernel module in Linux. When using KVM, QEMU can virtualize x86, server and embedded PowerPC, 64-bit POWER, S390, 32-bit and 64-bit ARM, and MIPS guests.

- [gdb](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/): GNU Debugger, which is also called gdb, is the most popular debugger for UNIX systems to debug C and C++ programs.

- [strace](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html) ([github link](https://github.com/strace/strace)): is a diagnostic, debugging and instructional userspace utility for Linux. It is used to monitor interactions between processes and the Linux kernel, which include system calls, signal deliveries, and changes of process state.

- [angr](http://angr.io/): angr is a python framework for analyzing binaries. It focuses on both static and dynamic symbolic ("concolic") analysis, making it applicable to a variety of tasks.

- [voltron](https://github.com/snare/voltron): Voltron is an extensible debugger UI toolkit written in Python. It aims to improve the user experience of various debuggers (LLDB, GDB, VDB and WinDbg) by enabling the attachment of utility views that can retrieve and display data from the debugger host. By running these views in other TTYs, you can build a customised debugger user interface to suit your needs.

- [nasm](http://www.nasm.us/): The Netwide Assembler (NASM) is an assembler and disassembler for the Intel x86 architecture. It can be used to write 16-bit, 32-bit (IA-32) and 64-bit (x86-64) programs. NASM is considered to be one of the most popular assemblers for Linux.
