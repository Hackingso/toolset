### System
- [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools/): pwntools is a CTF framework and exploit development library. Written in Python, it is designed for rapid prototyping and development, and intended to make exploit writing as simple as possible

- [metasploit](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework): The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is far more than just a collection of exploits. Itâ€™s an infrastructure that you can build upon and utilize for your custom needs. This allows you to concentrate on your unique environment, and not have to reinvent the wheel. I consider the MSF to be one of the single most useful auditing tools freely available to security professionals today.
