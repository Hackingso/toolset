### Cryptography
- [sagemath](https://github.com/sagemath/sage): sagemath is mathematical software with features covering many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus.

- [john-the-ripper](https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/): John the Ripper is a fast password cracker. It is one of the most popular password testing and breaking programs as it combines a number of password crackers into one package, autodetects password hash types, and includes a customizable cracker.

- [pycrypto](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycrypto): This is a collection of both secure hash functions (such as SHA256 and RIPEMD160), and various encryption algorithms (AES, DES, RSA, ElGamal, etc.). The package is structured to make adding new modules easy.

- [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/): OpenSSL is a general purpose cryptography library that provides an open source implementation of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols.

- [FeatherDuster](https://github.com/nccgroup/featherduster): is a tool used for breaking crypto which tries to make the process of identifying and exploiting weak cryptosystems as easy as possible.

- [Cipher Tools](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/): Easy to use web-based text manipulation tools.
