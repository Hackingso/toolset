- [volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility): The Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools, implemented in Python under the GNU General Public License, for the extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.

- [dd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_(Unix_software)): dd is a command-line utility for Unix and Unix-like operating systems whose primary purpose is to convert and copy files.

- [cuckoo](https://github.com/cuckoosandbox/cuckoo): cuckoo is a malware analysis system. It means that you can throw any suspicious file at it and in a matter of seconds Cuckoo will provide you back some detailed results outlining what such file did when executed inside an isolated environment

- [binwalk](https://github.com/devttys0/binwalk): Binwalk is a tool for searching a given binary image for embedded files and executable code. Specifically, it is designed for identifying files and code embedded inside of firmware images.

- [dff](https://github.com/arxsys/dff): dff is computer forensics open-source software. It is used by professionals and non-experts to collect, preserve and reveal digital evidence without compromising systems and data

- [Sleuth Kit](https://www.sleuthkit.org/): is a collection of command line tools and a C library that allows you to analyze disk images and recover files from them. It is used behind the scenes in Autopsy and many other open source and commercial forensics tools.

- [gpart](https://github.com/baruch/gpart): gpart is a software utility which scans a storage device, examining the data in order to detect partitions which may exist but are absent from the disk's partition tables

- [fdisk](https://www.gnu.org/software/fdisk/): fdisk is a dialog-driven program for creation and manipulation of partition tables. It understands GPT, MBR, Sun, SGI and BSD partition tables.

- [TrID](http://mark0.net/soft-trid-e.html): TrID is an utility designed to identify file types from their binary signatures. While there are similar utilities with hard coded logic, TrID has no fixed rules. Instead, it's extensible and can be trained to recognize new formats in a fast and automatic way.

- [gzsteg](http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/crypt/steganography/gzsteg.tar.gz): utility to hide and extract information from gz archives.
